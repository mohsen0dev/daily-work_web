    <h1>Privacy Policy — Work Days Logger</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: [Insert Date]</em></p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Work Days Logger does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.
        The only interaction with user data occurs when the app creates a local backup file
        or when the user chooses to upload this backup to their Google Drive.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Google Account Authentication</h2>
    <p>
        Google Sign-In is used solely to allow users to upload and restore their backup file in Google Drive.
        We do <strong>not</strong> access contacts, personal files, or any other content in the user's Google Drive
        except the specific backup file created by the application. We also do not store Google account data.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        All work logs and application data are stored locally on the user’s device using the Hive database.
        No data is transmitted to external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Backup on Google Drive</h2>
    <p>
        If the Google Drive backup feature is enabled, the app creates a backup file and stores it
        in a private folder within the user’s Drive. No one, including the developer, has access to this file.
        Users may delete the file at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>
        All backup operations are performed securely through Google’s official API.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not target children and does not collect any personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
