    <h1>About Work Days </h1>

    <p>
        Work Days is a simple and reliable application designed to help users record,
        track, and manage their daily work activities. The core goal of the app is to keep
        all information stored securely on the user's device using a local database powered by Hive.
    </p>

    <p>
        To prevent data loss, the app provides local backup and restore features. However,
        mobile devices may fail, be damaged, or get lost. Therefore, the app also allows users to
        upload their backup file to their personal Google Drive account.
    </p>

    <p>
        This Google Drive integration is used solely for one purpose:
    </p>

    <p><strong>✔ Uploading and restoring the user’s backup file safely.</strong></p>

    <p>
        The app does not collect personal data, does not upload content to external servers,
        and does not access any Google Drive files except the backup file created by the app.
    </p>

    <p>
        Google account authentication is required only to save the user’s backup file into
        their own Drive. No additional information is collected, stored, or shared.
    </p>

    <p>
        Work Days is designed with privacy, simplicity, and user control in mind.
    </p>
